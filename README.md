# OpenStarscape web app

This is the primary OpenStarscape frontend.

## To run locally

NOTE: you'll also need to build and run the [OpenStarscape server](https://github.com/OpenStarscape/starscape-server) locally for anything to work.

In production the server will serve the web app. More details on deploying [here](https://github.com/OpenStarscape/starscape-server/tree/master/deploy)
